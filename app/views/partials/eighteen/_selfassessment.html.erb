          <h3><strong>Returning the investment to TW.</strong></h3>
          <p>From practically three months of training post-billable (TW 101, TWU, and ACIT),
            five all expense-paid conferences, and the time and dedication given to me through
            my coaches and the AC program, I feel as though I have definitely been heavily
            invested in by ThoughtWorks. However, now that I am beginning to realize my skills
            and adapt to change quickly, I feel I am returning the investment to the company
            and be able to make meaningful contributions.</p>

        <h3><strong>New level technically.</strong></h3>
        <p>Throughout my last nine months working on a legacy, back-end system, I have reached a
          higher level with my Java skills, in particular using the Spring MVC framework,
          identifying areas in need of refactoring, and different techniques for writing integration
          test suites. I am more comfortable with back-end systems using camel messaging and SQL
          databases. Working on Jenkins pipelines, Vagrant boxes and Docker configuration has made me
          less afraid of the wonderful world of dev ops. Lastly, my experience outside the client
          has strengthened my confidence that I am able to quickly understand concepts in new
          languages and tooling.</p>

        <h3><strong>Finding balance between spreading influence and developing my skills.</strong></h3>
        <p>Working on an enablement project and attending seven conferences in the past six
          months, there has been an interesting dynamic between teaching and learning in my
          day-to-day activities. Realizing I spent my first six months at ThoughtWorks really
          focusing on absorbing as much information as I can for my personal development, I
          attempted to divide my efforts equally between not only learning for myself, but also,
          sharing what I have learned with the public through giving talks and helping others.</p>
